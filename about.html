            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Panagiotis Karagiannis, a passionate Software Engineer with a deep love for robotics and motorsport technology. Since July 2024, I’ve been part of Manthey Racing’s Vehicle Science Department, where I continue to push the boundaries of automotive engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before joining Manthey Racing, I was a key contributor to the FaSTTUBe Formula Student team, where I led the development of their first autonomous vehicle system. This marked FaSTTUBe’s debut in the driverless event category, and through my efforts, we significantly advanced autonomous racing technologies. My work encompassed the entire autonomous driving pipeline, from low-level controls and state estimation to vehicle control and path planning.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in software engineering started with a strong academic foundation at the Technical University of Berlin, where I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science. During this time, I also worked as a Research Assistant in the Machine Learning Department, helping integrate innovative tools such as an autograding framework for coursework.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a major proponent of open-source software and strive to make my personal projects openly available to the community. During my time at FaSTTUBe, I open-sourced the path planning algorithm I developed, which has since been adopted by many teams worldwide. My approach emphasizes precision, efficiency, and robust architecture, ensuring that every project I contribute to meets the highest standards. Whether it's developing advanced control systems or working on user-friendly tools, I always aim to create impactful, reliable, and accessible software.
            </p>
