                    Programming has been my passion since I was 12, and I have been actively working in Software Engineering within the fields of Motorsport and Robotics since 2019.
                    During my studies at the Technical University of Berlin, I was part of the FaSTTUBe team from 2019 to 2024, contributing to the "Driverless Software" department.
                    My efforts played a key role in securing multiple podium finishes in Formula Student competitions.

                <p>
                    In 2024, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the "Vehicle Science" department at Manthey Racing.
